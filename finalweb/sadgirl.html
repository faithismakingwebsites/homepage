  <h1>Everybody Loves a Sad Girl</h1>
  
  <p>
    You know her, eccentric, free-spirited, outgoing, yet carrying a hidden pain.
    No one really wants to hear about her pain, but they love the ways in which she hurts.
    <strong>Everybody Loves a Sad Girl</strong> investigates society’s need to romanticize women’s sadness.In the attempt to normalize mental illness we as a society have come to a point where it is a hot commodity- Time and time again we have proven that society love a sad girl. Self destructive traits have turned into sexy hobbies. Have we, as women, let our pain and darkness continue, because it is desired. What would happen if we dropped the idealism of pain? Are we stuck in a cycle of pain, causing our own demise? Can we change the way we look at ourselves and our pain? Deep down, do we hold onto our sadness?
