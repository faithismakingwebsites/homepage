<p> The Internets Back-to-the-Land Movement</p>
<p>Nothing is truly original. Everything has a history, a precedent, or a reference. The internet, which we often think of as a revolutionary and unprecedented tool, did not emerge from nowhere, like I always seemed to think. It became from a large group of ideas, movements, and concerns that predate digital tech.  </p>
