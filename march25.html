            Today, Oh today... Lets see.... I woke up around 8 ish and hmmmm, unsure, contemplation of sorts. 
            Made some bfeast, lay in the sun, send some emails, pay some bills. Lindsay came over for a little 
            to pararellel play. Then, I quickly hetaed up my food and had a little snack before Web. Web was good! 
            Lots of learning! I sit here now with my roomate as we both type visiouacly away... she wants to get ice 
            cream so I think thats what we shall do.  
            <span class="secret-text" onclick="unlockText()">"You are wrong. THIS is wrong. why would in inspect element. is it the suspense? or you just must know what im saying because its blurred? Silly you.... </span>.
            More to come as I must get some ice cream.
