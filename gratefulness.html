        <p>You do not have to walk on your knees<br>
        for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.<br>
        You only have to let the soft animal of your body<br>
        love what it loves.<br><br>

        Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.<br>
        Meanwhile the world goes on.<br>
        Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain<br>
        are moving across the landscapes,<br>
        over the prairies and the deep trees,<br>
        the mountains and the rivers.<br><br>

        Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,<br>
        are heading home again.<br>
        Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,<br>
        the world offers itself to your imagination,<br>
        calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and excitingâ€”<br>
        over and over announcing your place<br>
        in the family of things.</p>
