        <p>The Orange <br> <br>

            At lunchtime I bought a huge orange— <br>
            The size of it made us all laugh.<br>
            I peeled it and shared it with Robert and Dave 
            They got quarters and I had a half.<br>
            <br>
            And that orange, it made me so happy,<br>
            As ordinary things often do<br>
            Just lately. The shopping. A walk in the park.<br>
            This is peace and contentment. It’s new.<br>
            <br>
            The rest of the day was quite easy.<br>
            I did all the jobs on my list<br>
            And enjoyed them and had some time over.<br>
            I love you. I’m glad I exist.<br>
